* Object-Oriented features
* Familiar syntax
* Built-in state machine syntax
* Communicates between state machines
* Event parallelization
* Intuitive concurrency syntax
* Indentation rules

Compiler
====
It is written in pure Object Pascal with Plex and Pyacc. It is a source to source compiler. The programming language of the output format is Object Pascal (Free Pascal). With the Free Pascal compiler, the program that is written in Tomo can be compiled to machine code on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, FreeBSD etc. ...) and run in multiple processor architectures.

Requirements
====
Tomo requires the following software to be installed:
* [FreePascal Compiler](http://www.freepascal.org/)
* Plex
* Pyacc
